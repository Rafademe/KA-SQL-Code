# To pull up the data in a column, or "select" it, use the format below:

SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name>;

# To select all of the columns in a table, use * for <column_name> in the above format.

# Ex. 1

SELECT * FROM fav_books;

# To order the columns from smallest to largest (or A to Z) while bringling them up, use the format below:

# *Note* This requires a <reference_column> from which the ordering will de derived.

SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <reference_column>;

# Ex. 2

SELECT * FROM fav_books ORDER BY year;

# To filter results, use the WHERE clause, which applies a logical expression to seperate the data.

# Format:

SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> WHERE <logicalexpression>
ORDER BY <column_name>;

# Ex. 3

SELECT * FROM fav_books WHERE year > 1950
ORDER BY year;

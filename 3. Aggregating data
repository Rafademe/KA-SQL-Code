# Aggregate funcitions in SQL are useful for finding things like the maximum and minimum values, sum, avergae, etc.

# To find the sum, use the SUM aggregate funcition by following the format below:

SELECT SUM(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>;

# Ex. 1

SELECT SUM(copies_owned) FROM fav-books;



# To find the maximum, use the MAX aggregate funcition by following the format below:

SELECT MAX(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>;

# Ex. 2

SELECT MAX(copies_owned) FROM fav_books;



# To get categorized results from the aggregate funcitions, include the GROUP BY clause, using the format below:

# *Note* This requires a <reference_column> from which the categories will de derived and the results organized.

SELECT <reference_column>, SUM(<column_name>) FROM <table_name>
GROUP BY <reference_column>;

# Ex. 3

SELECT year, SUM(copies_owned) FROM fav_books
GROUP BY year;
